# Atom Black UI
A truly black high-contrast UI theme for Atom. It is based on Atom Dark but with a truly black background. It works best with Atom Black Syntax theme http://atom.io/packages/atom-black-syntax/ here.

## Terminal Styling ##
I've also built out some Atom-Black-compatible terminal and terminal emulator styles for Mac and PC.
The mac terminal style is basically the Smyck.terminal styles.
The PC terminal emulator styles for Bash and Shell are similar to Smyck but built separately.
High-level Instructions for installing these are here: https://github.com/academicjargon/bash-profiles
Direct links to these profiles are below.
I'll provide better, beginning-to-end instructions in the future.

### PC Terminal Emulator Styles ###
Also, if you are on a PC and have ConEmu, you can also download an
1. Atom Black-compatible shell terminal emulator style here https://github.com/academicjargon/bash-profiles/blob/master/.bashrc
2. Atom Black-compatible bash terminal emulator style here https://github.com/academicjargon/bash-profiles/blob/master/.profile

### Mac Terminal Styles ###
If you are on a Mac, you can also download an Atom Black-compatible terminal style http://atom.io/packages/atom-black-syntax/Smyck.terminal

### Note ###
This is still a work-in-progress. Will be updating as I go through the guide.
