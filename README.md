# Atom Black UI

A truly black UI theme for Atom. It is based on Atom Dark but with a truly black background. It works best with Atom Black Syntax theme [http://atom.io/packages/atom-black-syntax/] here.

Also, if you are on a PC and have ConEmu, you can also download an Atom Black-compatible shell terminal emulator style [https://github.com/academicjargon/bash-profiles] here.
